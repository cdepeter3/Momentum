# Momentum

This was a class project from last fall that analyzed the performance of a momentum trading strategy. Historical price data for all publicly-traded stocks from 1927-2019 was used to calculate, for each month, the return over the prior 12 months for every stock. These returns were sorted into deciles and used to create an ‘Up’ portfolio (the top decile of TTM returns), a ‘Down’ portfolio (bottom decile), and an ‘Up Minus Down’ portfolio (long Up, short Down). The returns of each of these portfolios were calculated for various holding periods over the entire timeframe.
